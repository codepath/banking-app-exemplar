# Banking App Exemplar Project

Banking app exemplar project using React

Twitter has kindly asked SITE interns to help them run an A/B test for their new UI. An A/B test is where an experimenter shows different UI screens to users and determines which interface they prefer.

Much of the styling has already been provided by Twitter's team, but they'd like SITE interns to implement the desired frontend functionality using React - a technology they've recently adopted.
